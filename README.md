# ScrumDinger Continued, Part 2

1. You arranged groups of views to create more complex views and described the appearance of your interface using the SwiftUI declarative syntax.
2. You established a hierarchy of views and ensured that each view uses a single source of truth for its data.
3. You used AVFoundation to produce audio feedback in response to events and incorporated a speech recognizer that transcribes live audio into written transcripts.
